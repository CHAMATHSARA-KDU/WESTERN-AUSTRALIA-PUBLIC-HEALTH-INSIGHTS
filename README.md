📊 Project Overview

The Western Australia Public Health Insights Dashboard is an interactive analytical report that visualizes key public health trends in Western Australia. It uses Microsoft SQL Server for database management and Power BI for data visualization.

This project aims to provide data-driven insights for policymakers, healthcare providers, and researchers — helping them identify and respond to public health challenges through clear, evidence-based decision-making.

🧩 Objectives

Import and manage public health datasets using SQL Server

Clean and transform raw data for analysis

Build interactive visual dashboards using Power BI

Identify key trends in health indicators such as birth rates, alcohol usage, cancer incidence, and injuries

Support data-informed public health strategies

⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Source

Data were obtained from the Australian Government’s open data portal:
🔗 https://www.data.gov.au

2. Data Preparation

Imported datasets into Microsoft SQL Server

Created a new database (health1)

Cleaned data (renamed columns, set data types, replaced null values)

Imported cleaned data into Power BI

3. Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
Microsoft SQL Server	Data import, cleaning, and querying
Power BI	Visualization and dashboard design
Excel	Preprocessing and restructuring data
📈 Dashboard Visualizations
1. Total Potentially Preventable Hospitalizations (PPH)

Donut Chart showing Acute, Chronic, and Vaccine-preventable conditions

DAX functions used to calculate proportions

Highlights the major contributors to hospitalizations

2. Low Birth Weight Trends

Shows birth weight trends (2010–2014) by region

Identifies disparities between metropolitan and rural areas

Recommends mobile healthcare and nutrition programs

3. Risk of Alcohol Usage

Line chart visualizing alcohol-related harm rate changes

DAX-based year-over-year risk growth calculations

Provides actionable insights for awareness campaigns and policy regulation

4. Cancer Incidents

Decomposition Tree showing population breakdown by cancer type

Regional and gender-based comparisons for breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers

5. Fertility & Stillbirth Rates

Line and Clustered Column Chart

Fertility rates averaged 1.85 births/woman (2009–2014)

Consistent stillbirth rates (~0.45%) indicate effective maternal healthcare

6. Injuries and Poisoning Contributions

Waterfall Chart highlighting decreases in accidents and poisoning rates

Uses DAX to calculate injury contributions dynamically

Demonstrates effectiveness of public safety policies

7. Age-Standardized Birth Rates (ASBR)

Line Chart for age-specific birth rate variations

Identifies teenage pregnancy trends and socioeconomic impacts

8. Consumer Health Indicators (Card Visuals)

Average daily fruit and vegetable intake

Physical activity rates

Smoking prevalence

Male-to-female ratio and total population metrics

9. Slicers

Region and Year filters (2009–2014) for dynamic interactivity

💡 Key Insights

Maternal health and fertility indicators show positive stability

Alcohol-related harm fluctuates due to social and policy factors

Cancer incidence varies by region and population density

Injury rates have declined, showing the success of safety interventions

Data visualization enables faster, clearer decision-making in healthcare

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can transform raw data into meaningful insights.
By visualizing public health metrics interactively, stakeholders can:

Identify regional health disparities

Evaluate policy effectiveness

Develop targeted public health strategies

Future work includes integrating real-time data, enhancing predictive analysis, and promoting equitable resource allocation across regions.
